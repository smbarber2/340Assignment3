    <p>Ajaw Explorations first got our start in Natlan, where our founder Kinich made a faustian pact with a possibly demonic dragon sovreign of fire. Their terms? Kinich gets access to Ajaw's <br />
    power in exchange for giving up the possession of his own body after he dies! Win-win. Our company is still located in Natlan and though we may be small, our team of travel agents are <br />
    passionate and dedicated to getting you the best experience. We want to make things as stress-free for you while keeping prices low, and any questions or concerns can be directed to feedback@genericemail.com. <br />
